Hey! I'm **Prajeesh**. ðŸ‘‹
</div>

I am an Earth system model developer with a Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science. I spent nearly a decade as the core developer of the IITM Earth System Model, contributing to advanced climate modeling. Currently, at KAUST, I am working on developing a regional ocean-atmospheric coupled model to enhance seasonal climate predictions for Saudi Arabia.

I am a self-taught programmer with a passion for software development and a deep interest in weather prediction and climate change research. I aspire to become a full-time software engineer, combining my skills in scientific modeling with innovative software solutions.
