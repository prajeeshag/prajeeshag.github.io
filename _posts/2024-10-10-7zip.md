I recently tested three tools for compressing 102 NetCDF files contain gridded rainfall data (138GB) and found [**7-Zip**](https://www.7-zip.org/) to be the best. Here's a quick comparison:

> **Note:** The tests were done on a multi-core machine, with 192 cores.

1. **7zz (7-Zip)**  
   ```bash
   7zz a -tzip test_archive.zip *.nc
   ```
   - Time: 1 minute 17 seconds
   - Final Size: 6.6GB

2. **tar + gzip**
   ```bash
   tar -cvzf test_archive.tar.gz *.nc
   ```
   - Time: 17 minutes
   - Final Size: 6.9GB

3. **tar + pigz (Parallel gzip)**
   ```bash
   tar cf - *.nc | pigz -p 150 > archive.tar.gz
   ```
   - Time: 6 minutes
   - Final Size: 6.8GB

If youâ€™re dealing with large datasets, 7-Zip is the quickest and most efficient choice.
